                <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
                <p>The Services are intended for a general audience. If you are under the age at which you can legally provide consent to data processing in your jurisdiction (e.g., under 13 in the United States or under 16 in some parts of the European Economic Area), you may use the Services only with permission from a parent or legal guardian, who must review and accept these Terms on your behalf.</p>

                <h2>2. Updates to These Terms</h2>
                <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. Material changes will be announced in‑app or on our website at least 7 days before they take effect. The "Last updated" date above will change. Continued use of the Services after modifications means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

                <h2>3. Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and share personal information. By using the Services, you agree to our data practices.</p>

                <h2>9. Intellectual‑Property Rights</h2>
                <p>We own or license all content in the Services, including text, graphics, logos, audio, and software ("Content").

All rights not expressly granted are reserved.</p>

                <h2>10. User Content</h2>
                <p>You may submit content ("User Content").

Do not submit content you do not have rights to. We may remove User Content at our discretion.</p>

                <h2>11. Third‑Party App Stores</h2>
                <p>Your use of the Services via Apple App Store, Google Play, or any other platform is subject to the platform's terms. Those terms may grant Maple Owl Games and the platform additional rights and impose additional obligations on you.</p>

                <h2>12. Third‑Party Sites & Services</h2>
                <p>The Services may link to third‑party sites or integrate third‑party SDKs (e.g., advertising, analytics). We do not control third‑party content and are not responsible for it. Your interactions with third‑party sites are governed by their own terms and policies.</p>

                <h2>13. Disclaimers</h2>
                <p>The Services are for entertainment purposes only. They are not intended to provide medical, legal, or professional advice. Use them at your own risk.</p>

                <h2>14. Other Policies</h2>
                <p>Additional policies or guidelines may apply to specific features; such policies are incorporated by reference.</p>

                <h2>15. Dispute Resolution, Arbitration & Class‑Action Waiver</h2>
                <p><strong>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.</strong> Most disputes can be resolved informally by contacting support@mapleowlgames.com. If we cannot resolve a dispute within 60 days, either party may elect binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco County, California, USA, unless you and we agree to a remote or telephonic hearing.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Claims must be brought individually; no class actions or representative proceedings.</li>
                    <li>Either party may pursue claims in small‑claims court in San Francisco County (or your county of residence) instead of arbitration.</li>
                    <li>This Section is governed by the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and survives termination.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You may opt out of arbitration by sending a written notice within 30 days of first accepting these Terms to:<br>
