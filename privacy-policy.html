                <h2>6. Security</h2>

                <p>We employ reasonable technical and organizational measures to safeguard information; however, no system is completely secure. If we are required by law to notify you of a breach we may do so electronically.</p>

                <h2>7. International Transfers & Region‑Specific Disclosures</h2>

                <p>We are headquartered in the United States and may process information in the U.S. and other countries where we or our service providers operate. These locations may have data‑protection laws that differ from those in your jurisdiction. We rely on recognized legal mechanisms (such as standard contractual clauses) to protect transferred data.</p>
